<h1>Network</h1>

<p>
Knowing about networking will help you to understand more complex things. I suggest learning and understanding of how networks work.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>Let's do it, let's first learn the basics of networking.</p>
<h3>Before you start.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remember that notes are important.</li>
  <li>If you don't understand something feel free to google it and try to understand it.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>This is a THM room, that will explain some basic concepts about networks. </p>

<p>Here is the link : <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bpnetworking">Networking</a></p>


<h3>After you finished</h3>
<p>Now at this point you already know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IP Address Classes.</li>
  <li>The Private Address Space.</li>
  <li>Binary - Decimal conversion and viceversa.</li>
</ul>

<div class="jumbotron">
    <div class="container">
      <p>The next section will contain only theoretical concepts about networking. This section will only contain links to other sites. I apologize for not putting a CTF challenge, but I also consider that is important to understand the following concepts. Also include these concepts in your notes.</p>

<h2>Networking Concepts</h2>

<p>In this section we'll cover some important Networking concepts that are worth to understand. This will allow you to understand how networks work and how data goes through the network.</p>

<h3>Before you start</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Notes!</li>
  <li>Occasionally review your notes, this will help you to remember and memorize.</li>
  <li>Try to understand everything, research somewhere else if something is not clear.</li>
  <li>Theoretical concepts are just as important as practice.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>OSI Model</h3>
<p>The first thing you should now is the OSI Model and how it works. You'll find what you need in here: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/"> OSI Model</a></p>



<h3>TCP/IP Model</h3>
<p>Then lets go to the next model: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/"> TCP/IP Model</a></p>



<h3>TCP vs UDP</h3>
<p>Now let's undestand the protocols: <a href="https://www.guru99.com/tcp-vs-udp-understanding-the-difference.html"> TCP vs UDP</a></p>


<h3>IP address</h3>
<p>Now your IP address: <a href="https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-an-ip-address"> What is an IP address?</a></p>

<p>Now find your ip address: <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/5/how-find-ip-address-linux">How to find your IP address in Linux</a></p>


<h3>HTTP</h3>
<p>Finally the HTTP and requests: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/"> What is HTTP?</a></p>


<p>Using CURL to do HTTP requests:: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/http-curl/"> The curl guide to HTTP requests</a></p>


<br>

<h3>After you finished</h3>
<p>Now at this point you already know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What does each OSI model layer do.</li>
  <li>What does each TCP/IP model layer do.</li>
  <li>Which is the main protocol used in all Internet operations.</li>
  <li>How does TCP work.</li>
  <li>How does UDP work.</li>
  <li>When using TCP.</li>
  <li>When using UDP.</li>
  <li>Difference between UDP and TCP.</li>
  <li>What is an IP address.</li>
  <li>How to display your IP address.</li>
  <li>What is HTTP protocol and how it works.</li>
  <li>What is curl.</li>
  <li>The parts of an HTTP request.</li>
  <li>How to send GET and POST requests.</li>

</ul>

<h3>THM-Suscribed Introductory Network</h3>

<p>This is a THM room that introduces to network, if you are subscribed, feel free to make this room, it's just like a refresher.</p>

<img  class="center-img" src="{{ '/assets/starting/IntroNetwork.png'}}" alt="">
<p>The room's link: <a class="center" href="https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking"> Introductory Network</a> </p>

      <p>That's all for now, there are a lot of concepts and stuff to learn, but will be okay with these ones, for now.</p>

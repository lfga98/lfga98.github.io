<h1>Python</h1>

<p>The next thing you should have notions is Python. Python is a programming language that is commonly used to automate manual testing. It's important to know how doing a simple script that would help us with our work. In this case you don't have to be a professional coder or code a complete app, we only need to know the basics about the language.</p>

<p>Feel free to choose either of these options, or both.</p>

<p>But the main topics to cover in this section are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python Introduction</li>
  <li>Python Flow Control</li>
  <li>Python Functions</li>
  <li>Python Datatypes</li>
  <li>Python Files</li>
  <li>Python Requests</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>We just want to give you some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remember that notes are important.</li>
  <li>Keep your codes apart from everything, in place where you can access them easily.</li>
  <li>Try to understand the codes that will allow you to modify it and automate what you need.</li>
  <li>Comment your codes if something is not clear.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Programiz</h2>

<p>This site offers beginner-friendly tutorials and examples to learn programming languages, it's really simple and intuitive, just have to put a little effort on it and it's worth it.</p>

<p>Here you'll find most of the content we need. Finishing up to the Python Files part is enough.</p>

<p>And the requests are not such a big deal you can check any post on any site, but it's important to you to know what you can do with the requests.</p>

<p>You can check this site: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_post.asp">Python Requests</a></p>

<h2>Intro to Python</h2>

<p>The other choice is to to do this TryHackMe room, but it's not a free room so if you have the opportunity to pay the subscription you'll be able to access this room that will cover the necessary topics of this section.</p>

<p>Now it's time for you to choose an option and complete the activity</p>

<hr>

<h2>After the activity</h2>
<p>Now at this point you already know how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declare variables.</li>
  <li>Use tuples, lists, sets or dictionaries.</li>
  <li>Use print and input.</li>
  <li>Import external modules to our script.</li>
  Use the arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, assignment and special operators.
  <li>Use if, if-else, loops, break-continue and pass. Flow control.</li>
  <li>Understand functions and know how to use a function.</li>
  <li>Open, write, read and close a file with python I/O</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus on these topics, it doesn't matter if you don't understand recursion, class, object or concepts like those, we highly recommend the Programiz course, it's more complete and take the THM as a refresher later on.</p>

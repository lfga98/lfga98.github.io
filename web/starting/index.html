<h1>Before you start</h1>

<p>Before we start there are some aspects that cannot be overlooked. These are the first concepts that I recommend should be covered, although they are not web hacking concepts, they are very useful and necessary.</p>

<p>This is section 0 of the guide that will contain the learning section and the final challenge section.</p>

<p>Feel free to jump any topic if you have the basic knowledge.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>As many know Linux is an operating system, the important thing about knowing this operating system is that it may be the environment we use to do our tests or it may be the environment we are attacking.</p>
<br>
<h3>Linux Filesystem</h3>
<p>First of all is to understand the linux file system. We'll ask you to read and understand the following blog: <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/">The Linux Filesystem Explained</a> </p>





<h4>Before you start reading</h4>
<p>We want to remind you that taking notes is important and clear and concise notes are better</p>
<p>We also want you to focus on the definition and content of each directory that is explained, it does not matter if you do not understand the commands yet, the purpose right now is to know the file structure of Linux.</p>

<p>If you want, you can try the commands that come and google their functions and meaning and add them at once to your notes, but they will also be covered later.</p>

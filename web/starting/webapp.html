<p>In this section we'll learn some basics about web apps, only what is necessary. </p>

<h2>Web vs Application server</h2>

<h2>What is a web application?</h2>
<p>Now we need to know what  a web application is: <a href="https://blog.stackpath.com/web-application/">What is a Web Application?</a></p>

<p>Now we need to know the two parts of a web application, a term used in web development but that we need to identify: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frontend-vs-backend/">Frontend vs Backend</a></p>
<p>In some cases, knowing something about the technologies used in the web applications could help us.</p>

<p>Also, is important to know the difference between a Web app and a Web site: <a href="https://www.guru99.com/difference-web-application-website.html">Difference between Website and Web Application </a></p>

<h2>Deploying our first Web App.</h2>


<p>Now let's deploy our first web app (if you have never deployed one before). This THM room called Django which teaches us how to do it, so let's follow along and try to do everything. This will give us an idea how web apps are built and deployed.</p>

<p> You'll need python installed and working, at this point you should have it. Let's go to the room: <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/django"> django</a></p>

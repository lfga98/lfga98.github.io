<h1>Introduction to the challenge section</h1>

<p>Coming ahead is the challenge section, in this section I'll put a set of challenges that will make you practice what you just learn. I'll want to give you some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't look at write ups or solutions, really try to do it by yourself.</li>
  <li>If you can't do it, then you are forgetting to do something, so recall your notes.</li>
  <li>Try to do your own write ups, include pictures and explanations.</li>
  <li>Google is your friend.</li>
</ul>

<div class="jumbotron">
    <div class="container">
      <p>In the challenge section you will not find a challenge that you cannot solve with the topics seen in the previous sections.</p>
      <p>Go ahead, try harder and have fun!</p>

<p>First, let's define front-end in this <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/frontend">article</a>. Now let's read a very basic information about front-end technologies and the one that we are interested in is javascript.</p>
<p>Technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://techterms.com/definition/html">HTML</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://techterms.com/definition/javascript">Javascript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more technologies, but for the moment we only need to know those.</p>

<p>And finally the last thing that we need to understand is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html">DOM</a>, try to read and understand everything, we are going to need these concepts. </p>

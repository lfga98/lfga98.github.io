<h1>My experience doing Code review (WIP)</h1>
<br>
<p>In this part of my blog, I'll share what I have learned in CTF's about doing Code Review to Web Applications. I'm doing this for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Besides being a great skill to have for a job or for Playing CTFs, I  think it is fun doing code reviews of web apps</li>
  <li>We have a lot of guides on how to do code reviews but there are things that you only learn by experience.</li>
  <li>I want to share and have a journal of what I'm learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope someone finds it useful.</p>

<h2>Before starting</h2>
<p>Before starting I just want to state some things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will not be using any kind of automated tools to look for vulnerabilities in code, let's just omit that part for now.</li>
  <li>I will be sharing my experience or examples from CTF challenges not from real projects.</li>
  <li>I will try to not repeat things from other guides or common vulnerabilities that are pretty obvious.</li>
  <li>I want to share how I'm developing this skill and my methodology,  I'm not reinventing the wheel so I want to share also those parts of how I do things.</li>
  <li>I'm going to separate the code review work into sections that you can find in this blog.</li>
  <li>I'm not focusing on a language, don't worry too much about it! We can do it!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Now let's start with this journey!</p>

        <h1 class="center">Week 5 - What I learned</h1>
<span class="post-date center">2021/05/18 to 2021/05/24</span>
<p>This week was a little bit crazy we did a lot of things and I think that I learned a lot and crazy stuff throughout the week. I'm going to start telling you the goals of the week, the problems that we faced, what we got, and the conclusions or lessons learned from the week. I'll try to summarize all those sections.</p>
<img class="center-img" src="/assets/encora/weekly/week6/chaos.jpeg" alt="how">
<p>First of all, as goals of the week, we needed to build a demo of the application that we design for the user. Just little parts of the application, we are working this way because we want to have quick feedback from the client that's why we are working fast. We worked on breaking up the parts of the application and defining things to do for the first demo. We had to build:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Login for different types of users.</li>
  <li>Create different views so that the user could see their information that needed to save.</li>
  <li>Create special forms so that users could upload their information and other users could see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's from the technical part and there other things you have to do to start coding, you have to define the scope, know what you have to do, assign tasks to members, have a visible board of tasks, select technologies, and other stuff. At this point I notice that it takes time and energy to do this and this won't be valuable for your user, I mean doing this in some way isn't visible for your user. </p>
<p>Also, I noticed that this is important and you have to do it in a way that everybody can understand and that everybody understands what is happening. But on the other hand, you shouldn't waste a lot of your time here, I mean is important but you will never get to perfect organization, let's just try to find the equilibration point. These were the main challenges of the week.</p>
<img class="center-img" src="/assets/encora/weekly/week6/board.jpeg" alt="how">
<p>Now doing this wasn't that easy we encountered a lot of problems and I'm just going to enum the ones that took me to realize things. I just want to state something, having problems is not something negative, it just happens and is a way to learn things, and all teams encounter problems and I think the best way to face these problems is to find a quick solution to them. Let's get to it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>We didn't have a good organization so we had to find a way to do it better to break tasks into little and atomic tasks so everybody could just take one and work in it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>We aren't professional nor beginners but we still had some bad time trying to find out how things work, this problem took a lot of time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<p>We still don't know all the things related to building a whole complete app so we had to study and do a lot of research. Here in this point, we used our abilities to learn as fast as possible</p>
<br>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>We had to deliver something functional so we had to move and fast and we had like that little pressure in our backs.</p>
<br>
<img class="center-img" src="/assets/encora/weekly/week6/chaosEng.jpeg" alt="how">

<p>What got finally is only the back-end working and little pieces of the front-end work, so this not a demo right... so we had to show something to the client so we need it to change things, we didn't show a working demo instead we tried to show and explain how the application is going to work by only showing most the backend, so this takes me to the lessons learned.</p>
<br>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We can show users other things that are valuable to them and it doesn't have to be only frontend components.</li>
  <li>Teams have problems and they solve them.</li>
  <li>Not everything is possible you have to let your client know when something is not possible</li>
</ul>
<br>
